### What's Durak?

[Durak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durak) is a simple and fun card game.

From Wikipedia: _"Durak is a traditional Russian card game"_.

### What's this?
Currently trying to make it in Rust, it's my first coding project ever and I'm bad at everything math/logic/problem-solving related.

Getting distracted and being confused are my mantras so it will probably never be finished.

### TODO

- [x] deck creation
- [x] player's hand creation
- [x] player's creation
  - [x] removing card from deck when players are generated
- [ ] making it responsive to user input
- [ ] game logic
- [ ] everything else
