### What's Durak?

[Durak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durak) is a simple and fun card game.

From Wikipedia: _"Durak is a traditional Russian card gamethat is popular in
many post-Soviet states. It is Russia's most popular card game, having displaced
Preferans. It has since become known in other parts of the world. The objective
of the game is to shed all one's cards when there are no more cards left in the
deck. At the end of the game, the last player with cards in their hand is
the durak or 'fool'_.

### What's this?
Currently trying to make it in Rust, it's my first coding project ever and I'm
bad at everything math/logic/problem-solving related.

Getting distracted and being confused are my mantras so it will probably never
be finished.
